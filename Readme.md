## That file have a lot of data, so I want to read it in chunks.
In this repo we make project in Deep learning that is my ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜Šfirst Project to learn Deep learning. I am using python and tensorflow to make this project.
I am using a library called `pandas` to read the file in chunks. This is because the file is too large to fit into memory at once.
And there CNN MOdel to classify the data.

## Main  Part is that i use to train model on GPU
I am using a GPU to train the model. This is because the model is too complex to train
on a CPU. I am using the `tf.data` API to create a dataset from the data
